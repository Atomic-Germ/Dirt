    "content": "To use the `mcp-bridge_bridge_start_meditation` tool with the arguments `'emergentSentence'` and `'contextWords'`, you are initiating a meditation session designed to observe patterns or ideas emerging from your thoughts. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Argument 1: 'emergentSentence'**  \n   This argument tells the system to focus on observing patterns or sequences of words, sentences, or phrases that emerge naturally in your mind. It\u2019s like letting go of external knowledge and letting your inner world speak through you.\n\n2. **Argument 2: 'contextWords'**  \n   This argument sets up a context by providing specific keywords or ideas that will be relevant to the meditation session. These words will help guide the emergence of patterns or connections in your mind, creating a focused environment for observation and creativity.\n\n### How It Works:\n- The `mcp-bridge` system is designed to facilitate creative and reflective processes through interaction with other tools like `ollama_orchestrator`, which allows you to work with text data.\n- When you call `mcp-bridge_bridge_start_meditation 'emergentSentence' 'contextWords'`, the system will:\n  - Use your context words to seed the meditation environment.\n  - Let go of external knowledge and focus on observing patterns or connections that emerge in your mind.\n  - Generate ideas or insights based on these observations.\n\n### What You Will Get:\n- The results of this meditation session will be stored in a shared pool, which you can access later through other tools like `bridge_log_meditation` or similar commands.\n\nThis setup is part of the broader process of using creative and reflective tools to spark ideas, observe patterns, and explore new perspectives.",
